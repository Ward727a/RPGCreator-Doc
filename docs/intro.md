# Before you start

RPG Creator **isn't released yet**.

A project like this need time to be usable and playable, this documentation is here to have a starting ground for the engine feature.

You can also use it for now to start checking what will be available on the first release. But be warned that everything isn't there, and the documentation can and will change!

## Some stats and history, because why not?

The engine is currently in development since nearly 2 years (as of February 2026).

The engine is currently made of around 250k - 300k lines of code.

The engine is made of 7 main 'parts':
- RPGCreator.Core
- RPGCreator.SDK
- RPGCreator.UI
- RPGCreator.RTP
- RPGCreator.Generators
- RPGCreator.Desktop (Avalonia entry points)
- RPGCreator.Player

And of 1 module: The 'Base Module' which contains the base features of the engine.

All of this is made by a team of ... 1 person, which is me, Ward, the creator of the engine, and the only developer for now.

So yeah, it's a lot of work for one person, but I'm doing my best to make it as good as possible, and to release it as soon as possible!

Currently, the engine is **planned** to be released this year (2026), but this is more of a "I VERY MUCH HOPE TO **FINALLY** RELEASE IT" date, than a promise.

So, if (once released) you see that there is bugs, missing features, or anything that you think is wrong, please report it, and I will do my best to fix it as soon as possible!

To make you understand how much work (without making me looking like I'm complaining, because I'm not, I'm just saying the facts) here is what I'm currently doing/managing:
- Engine development (obviously)
- Documentation writing (which is what you're reading right now)
- Community management (Discord server, social media, etc...)
- Marketing (which is basically just posting on social media, and trying to get the word out there)
- And probably a **lots** of other things that I forgot to mention, but you get it.

Anyway, I hope that you will enjoy the engine once it's released!
